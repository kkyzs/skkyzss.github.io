			<p>This will be the last entry in this diary. I got rid of everything. Trashed the pill and burned the research papers, there's no going back now, and I'll eventually face the same fate that Algernon did, <b>but I have no regrets.</b> I put my name down for residence at a state-sponsored home for the mentally handicapped. They were confused as to why I want to be admitted in there, but I guess that in itself is an anomaly that was enough to get my accepted. Why? I can't stand the thought of being pitied by my friends and coworkers. I guess I still have some pride left despite my intelligence generally regressing. It's been a long year.
			<br>
			<br>
			To the person that finds this diary, <b>all I wish is for you to lay flowers for Algernon once in awhile.</b></p>
