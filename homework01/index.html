		<h2>6th June 2018 - "I'm Happy"</h2>

		<div class="text">
			<p>Today was a great day. It started badly though, I tripped and bumped into one of the shelves at work. The things were expensive and the manager wasn't very happy about it, he scolded me in front of many people. After work, many kids got full marks on the test and got sweets from the teacher. I didn't do well so they laughed at me, but the teacher gave me a sweet anyway so I'm still happy! But I have to keep working harder, or else uncle said I'd have to go to a mental hospital.</p>

		<h2>11th October 2018 - "Miracle"</h2>

		<div class="text">
			<p>It was a miracle - I became smart. They told me the risks were high, since I'd be the first test subject, but it worked wonders! Neurosurgery that stimulates brain activity to increase intelligence, you'd think something like this were only possible in fiction, but it's actually real! Learning and understanding is a breeze now with this new found gift of intelligence. The professor has also offered me a place at the research center. Starting next week, I'll be observing and studying this mouse - I think its name was Algernon - that was supposedly the first sucessful test subject of the professor's research.
			<br>
			<br>
			Initial studies and observations are finally done too, it's been a few months but I'll finally be allowed to leave the research center this weekend.</p>

		<h2>21st January 2019 - "Rest In Peace, Algernon"</h2>

		<div class="text">
			<p>My only friend has died today - yes, the mouse. Where did everything go wrong? The people who I thought were my friends only saw my as an idiot and I was only there for their amusement. The professor, whom I held in such high regard, only cares I exist since I'm the fruit of his research, nothing more. The only one that mattered to me, Algernon, is now gone too.
			<br>
			<br>
			I've been observing him for a few months now, and I know that eventually, while losing my intelligence, I will inevitably meet the same fate as Algernon. I haven't reported it to the professor, I doubt he cares anyway.
			<br>
			<br>
			I've actually found a way to prevent myself from facing the same fate that Algernon did. A pill that stops any regression of neural activity, once again sounds too good to be true, but it is. Imagine the things I could do with this research! All I have to do is take this pill, yet, why am I hesitating?</p>
