        <br>
        <br>
        It's all meaningless. No matter what dreams or hopes you had, no matter how blessed of a life you've lived... It's all the same if you're shredded by rocks. Everyone will die someday. Does that mean that life is meaningless? Was there even any meaning in our being born? Would you say that of our fallen comrades? Their lives... Were they meaningless?
        <br>
        <br>
        No they weren't! It's us who gives meaning to our comrades lives! The brave fallen! The anguished fallen! The ones who will remember them... are us, the living! We die trusting the living who follow to find meaning in our lives! That is the sole method in which we can rebel against this cruel world!
        <br>
        <br>
        My soldiers, rage! My soldiers, scream! My soldiers, fight!</p>
